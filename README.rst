ComPASS aims at being an open, evolutive platform for hydrothermal modeling.
It implements state of the art numerical scheme to discretize multiphase
Darcean flows on generic unstructured meshes.

The Compass code is developped through collaborations,
it is an open source platform which belongs to all the co-developpers:
Université Côte d'Azur (LJAD - Inria); BRGM; ANDRA.


Our main goals are:

- to achieve an intuitive high-level API with simple scripts
  and a DSL-like approach based on Python,
- target the specification of the physics at the level of the
  python script without loss of efficiency to be able
  to develop and reuse easily different physics.

  The collaborative development is made through the
  `INRIA gitlab platform <https://gitlab.inria.fr/compass/v4/ComPASS>`_
  and the documentation is served
  `here <https://compass.gitlab.io/compass-v4/doc/>`_.
  The code is available on `gitlab.com <https://gitlab.com/compass/compass-v4>`_.
