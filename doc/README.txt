This directory contains all files relative to the documentation.
The documentation is generated using Sphinx.
You can build the doc with the doxygen generation (can be long) using

source make_the_doc --with-doxygen

or only the sphinx generation using

source make_the_doc

The generated documentation is in the html directory.
