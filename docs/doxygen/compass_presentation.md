#  Brief history of the code ComPASS


The objectives of ComPASS are to develop efficient parallel numerical methods 
to simulate gas liquid compositional thermal flow in high energy geothermal 
reservoirs.                   <br>


First version developed during the Cemracs summer school in 2012 by C. Guichard, C. Yang, R. Masson, P. Hav√©. 
<a target="_blank" href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00781235/">Compass: a tool for distributed parallel finite 
volume discretizations on general unstructured polyhedral meshes</a>          <br>
    
The second version implementing an immiscible two phase Darcy flow model and developed by C. Guichard, 
R. Eymard and R. Masson has been deposited at APP in 2014. 
<a target="_blank" href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00958131">High Performance Computing linear algorithms 
for two-phase flow in porous media</a>          <br>

The current version is developed during the ongoing inter Carnot postdoctoral fellowship of F. Xing 
in collaboration between BRGM and LJAD-INRIA.       <br>

\example hexa6_wellprod.msh
This is an example of a cartesian mesh with 6 cells and 3 wells (2 injectors and 1 productor).
The fractures are defined in File DefGeometry.f90
