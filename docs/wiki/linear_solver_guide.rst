## Introduction

Linear systems in ComPASS are solved using specific objects called LinearSolver implemented in the ComPASS.linalg package. This document describes the implementation of linear solvers in ComPASS and sums up a few strategies for you to manage your own solvers.

## Different types of solvers and implementations

In ComPASS there are two kinds of linear solvers, direct and iterative, each having two different possible implementations.
Direct solvers use an LU decomposition of the matrix to find a solution to the linear system
$`Ax=b`$. This type of solver can solve any system, but is not parallelizable and costs about $`\frac{2}{3}n^3`$ operations (with $`n`$ the number of unknowns/equations),
which makes it not suitable for large problems. It should be used for smaller systems, or when iterative solvers don't converge.

Iterative solvers use the GMRES method with preconditioning to iteratively reduce the distance between an arbitrary first guess and the solution. The convergence of this type
of solvers is highly dependent on preconditioner quality, meaning that basic preconditioners will lead to slow convergence or even divergence in case of complex physics,
like in the ComPASS context. The default preconditioning method in ComPASS is CPR-AMG, an efficient method designed for linear systems in the context of Darcy flow physics.
In general, GMRES with CPR-AMG preconditioning is the best method in ComPASS simulations. A description of this method can be found in the wiki.

Each of these linear solvers has two different implementations : the `Legacy` and the `Petsc` versions. The default is still the `Legacy` implementation and
uses old Fortran routines, while the latter is a new implementation that uses the petsc4py interface. Eventually the `Legacy` version is bound to disappear, but more tests have to be made
with the newer `Petsc` implementation before we can guarantee accurate and robust results. Advantages and disadvantages of these two methods are discussed in the next paragraph.
## Command line options

A default implementation of the new `PETSc` version provides the same the behavior explained in the previous paragraph.

When running a default `standard_loop(simulation)`, the linear solver is instanciated internally together with the Newton object that manages the newton loop,
and cannot be accessed from the script that called the time loop. However, command line options for ComPASS linear solvers are available for basic usage, and can be used to set the default linear solver :

  - `--legacy_linear_solver <True/False>` : Switch between the Fortran and the Python implementations
  - `--direct_linear_solver <True/False>` : Switch between direct and iterative solver
  - `--linear_solver_view <True/False>` : Display a view of the linear solver object at constructor call
  - `--dump_ls <time>` : Write the PETSc linear system (matrix and right hand side) in an ASCII format file at the end of time step `<time>` (slow in parallel)
  - `--dump_ls_binary <time>` : Write the PETSc linear system (matrix and right hand side) in a binary format file at the end of time step `<time>` (useful for external processing of the linear system, not available in the `Legacy` version)

### Examples

Running the following code from file `test/linalg/solving_from_options.py` :

```python
    from ComPASS.linalg.factory import linear_solver

    command_line_lsolver = linear_solver(simulation, from_options=True)
```

with the command :

```console
$ python3 solving_from_options.py --legacy_linear_solver False --direct_linear_solver True --linear_solver_view True
```

should display the following output :

```console
    LinearSolver object view:
      Direct
      petsc4py new implementation
```

## Instanciate your own linear solver object

The easiest and fastest way of getting your own `LinearSolver` object is to use the factory function from the `ComPASS.linalg.factory` file:

    def linear_solver(
        simulation,
        legacy=True,
        direct=False,
        activate_cpramg=None,
        tolerance=None,
        max_iterations=None,
        restart_size=None,
        from_options=False,
    ):

### Description of the factory function's arguments

  - `simulation` :       The simulation object from which the linear system is going to be built
  - `legacy` :           A boolean switch bewteen the `Legacy` and `Petsc` versions
  - `direct` :           A boolean switch between direct and iterative solver
  - `activate_cpramg` :  A boolean switch to turn the CPR-AMG preconditioner on or off. Defaults to `None` in case of direct solver, and `True` if  an iterative solver is chosen.
  - `tolerance` :        Relative decrease in the residual norm required for iterative solver convergence, defaults to 1e-6
  - `max_iterations` :   Maximum number of iterations accepted before iterative solver divergence, defaults to 150
  - `restart_size` :     Number of iterations at which GMRES restarts, defaults to 30
  - `from_options` :     Enable command line options (set to `True` in the `standard_loop()` call to the factory)

To pass the linear solver object to the simulation loop, you must call the Newton object constructor. The Newton constructor takes four arguments :
The simulation object, the relative tolerance on residual decrease to achieve Newton convergence, the maximum number of iterations, and a linear solver object.
The example below shows how to use a direct solver of the `Petsc` kind :

    from ComPASS.linalg.factory import linear_solver

    # Use the factory function to instanciate your own LinearSolver
    lsolver = linear_solver(simulation, legacy=False, direct=True)

    # Construct your own Newton object instead of using the default
    newton = Newton(simulation, 1e-5, 8, lsolver)

    # Pass the Newton object to the standard_loop function
    simulation.standard_loop(
        newton=newton,
        initial_timestep=30 * day,
        final_time=30 * day,
        output_period=year,
        context=context,
    )

### Note on the two different versions

It is deliberately hidden that both implementations actually use the PETSc library, because we eventually want to get rid of the `Legacy` implementation.
The `Legacy` version uses the Fortran interface, and the `Petsc` version uses the petsc4py bindings. Since both strategies initialize PETSc, using multiple types of solvers in the same execution
can lead to unexpected behaviour. This means **you should make a choice between `Legacy` and `Petsc`** when running an input script which explicitely uses linear solvers.

Both version are essentially identical, but there are a few things to note on the `Legacy` version :

  - It has been the default implementation for a while and has been tested on many different simulations, so it should be reliable
  - The PETSc objects in the Fortran layer are global, which means that it is not possible to have multiple `Legacy` linear solver instances.
  A new instanciation will overwrite the settings of the first, and both Python instances will refer to the same Fortran Petsc objects.

### Manipulating linear solvers

It is possible to access an iterative solver's parameters using the 'dot' symbol :

    from ComPASS.linalg.factory import linear_solver

    # Let's set up a legacy iterative solver, but with CPR-AMG disabled
    leg_it_lsolver = linear_solver(simulation, legacy=True, direct=False, activate_cpramg=False)

    leg_it_lsolver.tolerance = 1.e-5
    leg_it_lsolver.max_iterations = 100
    leg_it_lsolver.restart_size = 20

Linear solvers also feature Ã  `__str__` method, so you can display information about the object with a `print()` statement (or `mpi.master_print()` in parallel) :

    from ComPASS.linalg.factory import linear_solver

    # Let's set up a petsc iterative solver, with specific settings
    ptc_it_lsolver = linear_solver(simulation, legacy=False, tolerance=1e-7, max_iterations=250, restart_size=50)

    print(ptc_it_solver)

Output :

    LinearSolver object view:
      Iterative
      petsc4py new implementation
      Settings : IterativeSolverSettings(tolerance=1e-07, max_iterations=250, restart_size=50)
      CPR-AMG : activated

## Extra docs and examples

A few scripts can be found in the test/linalg directory and can serve as examples on how to set and use linear solvers in ComPASS. Extra doc on the
CPR-AMG preconditioning method and its implementation in the `Petsc` version can be found in the GitLab wiki.
