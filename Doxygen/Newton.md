Newton Algorithm    {#newton} 
===========================

The Newton algorithm consists in .....

Unknowns

Equations

Closure laws


## Calcul of the Jacobian with pre-elimination thanks to the closure laws.

 - Xk = Xkp, Xks
 
 - Elimination of the secondary unknowns : 
 Number of primary unknowns.
 
 - Assembly of \ref resjac "the second membre and the Jacobian"
 
 - Reduced system (Schur complement)
 
 - Post-treatment of the Jacobian after the assembly
 
## Newton incrementation
