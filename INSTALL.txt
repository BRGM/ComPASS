Cmake modules to find external packages :
* FindPETSC and others from Jed Brown's github repository https://github.com/jedbrown/cmake-modules
* FindMETIS from Dune setup

Usefull packages on ubuntu 16.10:
build-essential
(cmake) cmake-curses-gui or cmake-qt-gui
gfortran
liblapack-dev
libmetis-dev
mpi-default-dev
libvtk6-dev

On Ubuntu lower than 16.10 you may also need to install libproj-dev package.

Useful environment variables
#  PETSC_DIR - directory in which PETSc resides
#  PETSC_ARCH - build architecture
HDF5_ROOT

If you have Anaconda on your path it may help to place it at the end of your path.
cmake -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH=`which python` may also help to use pybind11.
